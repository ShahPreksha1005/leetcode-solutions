**Problem Statement:**
You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k. Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:
1. Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
2. The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

**Approach:**
We follow a greedy approach where we iterate through the sorted array and try to form groups of size 3 while ensuring that the difference between any two elements in one group is less than or equal to k.

**Implementation:**
- Sort the input array `nums`.
- Initialize an empty 2D array `result` to store the arrays that satisfy the conditions.
- Iterate through the sorted array, and for each element:
  - If `result` is empty or if the current element is greater than the last element of the last array in `result` plus `k`, create a new array containing the current element and append it to `result`.
  - Otherwise, append the current element to the last array in `result` if the size of the last array is less than 3.
- If all elements are successfully grouped into arrays of size 3, return `result`; otherwise, return an empty array.

**Example Usage:**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 3, 5, 1]
k = 2
print(divide_array(nums, k))  # Output: [[1, 1, 3], [3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]
