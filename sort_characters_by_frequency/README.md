
## Sort Characters by Frequency
### Problem Description:

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Example:

Refer to the provided examples.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5
- s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

### Approach:

To solve this problem, we can count the frequency of each character in the string and then use a priority queue to sort the characters based on their frequency. We iterate through the characters and append each character to the result string based on its frequency.

### Code Implementation:

Refer to the provided code.
