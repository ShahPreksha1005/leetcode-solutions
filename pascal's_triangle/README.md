
#### Pascal's Triangle

Given an integer `numRows`, return the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first row consists of a single 1.

##### Example:

Input: `numRows = 5`

Output: `[[1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1], [1,4,6,4,1]]`

Explanation: The first five rows of Pascal's triangle are:
```
    [1]
   [1,1]
  [1,2,1]
 [1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```

Input: `numRows = 1`

Output: `[[1]]`

Explanation: The first row of Pascal's triangle is a single 1.

##### Constraints:

- 1 <= numRows <= 30
