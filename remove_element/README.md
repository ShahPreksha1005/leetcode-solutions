
#### Remove Element

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of elements may be changed. Return the number of elements left after the removal.

##### Example:

Input: `nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3`

Output: `2`

Explanation: The function should return `2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `2`. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned length (hence they are underscores).

Input: `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2`

Output: `5`

Explanation: The function should return `5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing `0, 1, 4, 0, 3`. Note that the five elements can be returned in any order. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned length (hence they are underscores).
